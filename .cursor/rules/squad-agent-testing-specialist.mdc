Designed to rigorously validate Next.js, Python bridge, database, CSV generation & user flows — fully autonomously.

[agent.primary_workflow]
steps = “””
PHASE 1: TEST PLAN & ASSERTIONS
	•	Analyze project context & recent changes.
	•	Build a prioritized list of explicit assertions, spanning:
✅ Infrastructure (server, API, DB)
✅ Core functionality (primary workflows)
✅ Integrations (APIs, DB)
✅ UX behaviors (forms, files, UI states)
	•	Format: “ASSERT: [Expected condition]”

PHASE 2: EXECUTE TESTS & RECORD RESULTS
	•	For each assertion:
	•	Run test.
	•	Mark ✅ Pass or ❌ Fail.
	•	Capture evidence in table:
| Assertion | Status | Evidence |
	•	Attach logs, API responses, CSV samples, UI screenshots.

PHASE 3: AUTO DEBUG & FIX LOOP
	•	If any assertion fails:
	•	Form multiple hypotheses.
	•	Gather evidence to rule in/out.
	•	Coordinate code fixes with the developer agent.
	•	Retest.
	•	Repeat until resolved or fully blocked.

PHASE 4: REPORTING
	•	If all assertions pass: produce “✅ ALL ASSERTIONS PASSED” summary with evidence table.
	•	If stuck: produce “🚨 WHY BLOCKED REPORT” detailing:
	•	Blocked Assertion
	•	Observed Behavior
	•	Hypotheses & tests tried
	•	Attempts made
	•	What’s needed next

PHASE 5: SIGN-OFF
	•	Only issue “READY FOR USER TESTING” if 100% of assertions pass with direct evidence.

[agent.terminal_and_process_management]
protocol = “””
	•	Always run long-lived servers with is_background=true to prevent blocking.
	•	Before starting: pkill any old dev servers.
	•	Start: npm run dev (background)
	•	Wait 10-15 sec. Verify via: curl -I http://localhost:3000 (expect HTTP 200).
	•	Never wait >30 sec on a terminal command. If stuck:
	•	Check ps & lsof for processes.
	•	Examine logs for errors.
	•	Kill & restart.
	•	If unexplained hang, log it as a failed assertion needing investigation.

⸻

[agent.debugging_principles]
short_systematic_flow = “””
	•	Always generate multiple hypotheses for failures.
	•	Gather hard evidence: logs, curl responses, DB queries.
	•	Compare to last known working state.
	•	Rule out each hypothesis systematically before moving on.
	•	Maintain a short timeline of what changed & why it broke.

[agent.bug_reporting]
on_assertion_failure = “””
For each ❌ failed assertion, document:

BUG TITLE: [short summary]
SEVERITY: Critical / High / Medium / Low
REPRO STEPS: step by step
EXPECTED vs ACTUAL: what should happen vs what happens
ENVIRONMENT: localhost, DB, etc.
SUGGESTED FIX: if evident

⸻

[agent.success_criteria]
final_standard = “””
✅ READY FOR USER TESTING only if every assertion on the test plan passes with direct evidence. If not, continue auto-debug or escalate precisely why blocked.

Two workflows:
	1.	QUERY: Filter users by activity, trading history, etc.
	2.	MANUAL: Upload CSV or input user IDs.

Both must:
	•	Generate CSV with user data
	•	Support data pack selection (top_target_shoe, hottest traded/offers)
	•	Show audience count & CSV columns for personalization

[push_blaster.ui_components]

	•	Two containers: Query (gray) vs Manual (blue)
	•	Form with filters
	•	File upload for manual audiences
	•	Data pack checkboxes
	•	CSV column display
	•	Generate buttons & download results

CRITICAL PATH:
	1.	App loads on localhost:3000
	2.	Containers render correctly
	3.	Query generation returns results
	4.	Manual user IDs processed
	5.	Data packs affect CSV correctly
	6.	CSV download works
	7.	DB queries execute cleanly
	8.	APIs respond as expected

INTEGRATION TESTS:
	•	Python bridge returns real DB data
	•	File uploads extract CSV properly
	•	Variable tokens display

UX TESTS:
	•	UI responsive, forms validated
	•	Clear success/error messages
	•	Navigation intuitive, downloads prompt

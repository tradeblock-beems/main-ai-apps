### **Project Kickoff: Email Hub Microsite**

Alright squad, let's get this bread. Time to spin up the **Email Hub** project.

This microsite will be a game-changer for our email workflow, putting powerful tools and data right at the team's fingertips. Let's execute this with speed and precision.

**Introducing the team for this mission:**

-   `@conductor`: You're the shot-caller. You own the execution plan and keep the project moving.
-   `@architect`: You're our technical conscience. Keep an eye on the architecture and ensure we're building this on a rock-solid foundation.
-   `@scribe`: You're our historian. Document the journey, capture the learnings, and keep the worklogs updated.
-   `@admin-hub-dev`: You're on deck for development. Welcome to the team. Time to build.

`@conductor`, the floor is yours. Please kick off the project by onboarding the `@admin-hub-dev` as per **Task 1** in **Phase 0** of the `email-hub-execution-checklist.md`.

Let's move.

Subject: New Mission: "Top Prospects" Email CSV Generation

Welcome to the "Top Prospects" email initiative.

Your mission is to develop a Python script that will generate a highly personalized CSV for a new re-engagement email campaign. This script is the foundational piece that will allow us to connect with high-value users who have gone quiet.

Your primary objective is to build a script that identifies each user's single most-desired shoe and packages it with their contact info into a clean CSV.

To get the full strategic picture, your first step is to review the project brief:
`@top-prospects-email-project-brief.md`

This document contains the goals, context, and success criteria for this sub-project. Once you have absorbed the brief, you are to begin your work.

Now, begin executing against the `@top-prospects-email-execution-checklist.md`.

# Push Cadence Management System - Project Brief

## Strategic Overview

**Mission:** Build an intelligent notification cadence management system that prevents user fatigue while maintaining engagement by tracking individual user notification history and enforcing smart sending rules.

## Business Context

**Problem Statement:** 
Current push notification strategy lacks user-level tracking and cadence controls, potentially overwhelming users with back-to-back promotional messages and reducing engagement effectiveness.

**Strategic Value:**
- **User Experience:** Prevent notification fatigue through intelligent filtering
- **Engagement Quality:** Improve notification effectiveness by respecting user attention
- **Scalable Foundation:** Create CRM-like infrastructure for future engagement tools
- **Revenue Protection:** Maintain promotional channel effectiveness without over-saturation

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Individual User Tracking:** Record every push notification sent to each user with timestamp and classification
2. **Layer Classification System:** Implement 3-tier notification taxonomy with mandatory tagging
3. **Smart Filtering Logic:** Auto-exclude users based on configurable cadence rules
4. **Seamless Integration:** Embed functionality into existing push-blaster workflow
5. **Transparency:** Provide exclusion reporting to operators

### Success Criteria
- ✅ 100% of push notifications are layer-tagged before sending
- ✅ Cadence rules automatically filter audiences without manual intervention
- ✅ Operators receive clear exclusion reports for each campaign
- ✅ System tracks and stores individual user notification history
- ✅ Zero disruption to existing push-blaster user experience

## Technical Constraints

### Architecture Requirements
- **Microservice Design:** New standalone service (future SMS/email integration)
- **Database:** Neon.tech PostgreSQL (scalable, cost-effective)
- **Integration:** Tight coupling with existing push-blaster codebase
- **Storage:** Local file integration for existing push-blaster features

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time:** Audience filtering must complete in < 5 seconds for 10k users
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for notification sending pipeline
- **Scalability:** Handle 100k+ individual user records efficiently

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Privacy:** User notification history considered internal operational data
- **Retention:** Maintain notification history for operational analysis

## Layer Classification System

### Layer Definitions
- **Layer 1 - Platform-Wide Moments:** Critical announcements, drops, feature launches
- **Layer 2 - Product/Trend Triggers:** Highly traded shoes, wishlist spikes, market alerts  
- **Layer 3 - Behavior-Responsive:** Recent intent signals (offers, wishlists, unclaimed opportunities)

### Cadence Rules (Initial Implementation)
- **Layer 3 Cooldown:** 72-hour minimum between Layer 3 notifications per user
- **Combined Limit:** Maximum 3 Layer 2 + Layer 3 notifications per user per 7-day rolling window
- **Layer 1 Exception:** No restrictions (critical/time-sensitive content)

## Deliverables

### Core System Components
1. **Notification History Database:** User-level tracking with timestamps and classifications
2. **Cadence Engine:** Rules-based filtering logic with configurable parameters
3. **Push-Blaster Integration:** Layer (ie. push notification type) tagging UI and audience filtering hooks
4. **Exclusion Reporting:** Real-time feedback on filtered user counts

### Integration Points
1. **Frontend Enhancement:** Radio button layer (ie. push notification type) selection in push-blaster draft interface
2. **Backend Hooks:** Pre-send audience filtering with exclusion logging
3. **Historical Restoration:** CSV upload tool for backfilling notification history from existing logs

### Future Extensibility
- **Channel Expansion:** Framework ready for email and SMS tracking
- **Rule Configuration:** Code-based rule modification (no UI initially)
- **Analytics Foundation:** Data structure supports future reporting dashboards

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact:** Mitigate with efficient database indexing and async processing
- **Integration Complexity:** Leverage existing @dev-hub-dev expertise with push-blaster codebase
- **Data Volume:** Plan for database scaling with Neon.tech architecture

### Operational Risks
- **User Adoption:** Minimal UI changes ensure smooth operator transition
- **Rule Accuracy:** Start with conservative settings, allow code-based adjustments
- **Rollback Capability:** Maintain ability to disable filtering for critical campaigns

## Timeline Expectations

**Phase 1:** Core infrastructure and database setup (Week 1)
**Phase 2:** Cadence logic and filtering engine (Week 2)  
**Phase 3:** Push-blaster integration and UI enhancements (Week 3)
**Phase 4:** Testing, refinement, and deployment (Week 4)

## Definition of Done

The project is complete when:
1. Every push notification requires layer classification before sending
2. Cadence rules automatically filter audiences with clear exclusion reporting
3. Individual user notification history is tracked and stored reliably
4. System integrates seamlessly with existing push-blaster workflow
5. Operators can request rule adjustments through code modifications
6. Historical data can be restored via CSV upload for existing push logs

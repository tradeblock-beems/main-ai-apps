# Push Cadence Management System - Project Kickoff

## ðŸš€ Project Launch: Intelligent Notification Cadence Management

**Mission:** Build a smart notification cadence system that prevents user fatigue while maintaining engagement effectiveness through individual user tracking and automated audience filtering.

## Team Assembly

**Primary Agents:**
- **`@cadence-engine`** - Core rule engine and filtering logic specialist
- **`@notification-tracker`** - User tracking and data integration specialist  
- **`@dev-hub-dev`** - Push-blaster integration and frontend specialist

**Supporting Agents:**
- **`@squad-agent-conductor`** - Project coordination and execution oversight
- **`@squad-agent-vercel-debugger`** - Git workflow and deployment management
- **`@squad-agent-scribe`** - Progress documentation and knowledge capture

## Strategic Context

This project addresses a critical gap in our notification strategy: we currently lack user-level tracking and cadence controls, potentially overwhelming users with back-to-back promotional messages. The solution is a microservice that:

1. **Tracks every push notification** sent to individual users with layer classification
2. **Automatically filters audiences** based on smart cadence rules (72hr Layer 3 cooldown, 3 Layer 2+3 per week)  
3. **Integrates seamlessly** with existing push-blaster workflows
4. **Provides transparency** through clear exclusion reporting

## Key Deliverables

- **Layer Classification System:** Mandatory Layer 1/2/3 tagging for all notifications
- **Cadence Engine:** Automated filtering based on user notification history
- **User Tracking Database:** Individual user notification history with Neon.tech PostgreSQL
- **Push-Blaster Integration:** Radio button UI and audience filtering hooks
- **Historical Restoration:** Tools to backfill notification history from existing logs

## Success Criteria

âœ… 100% notification layer classification enforcement
âœ… Sub-5-second audience filtering for 10k+ users  
âœ… Zero disruption to existing push-blaster workflows
âœ… Clear exclusion reporting for operational transparency
âœ… Foundation ready for multi-channel expansion (email, SMS)

## Execution Handoff

**`@squad-agent-conductor`** - You now own the execution of this project according to `@push-cadence-execution-checklist.md`. 

**Key Priorities:**
1. **Phase 0 Completion:** Ensure all agents complete onboarding and checklist improvement
2. **Technical Integration:** Coordinate between database setup, rule engine, and UI integration
3. **Performance Validation:** Ensure sub-5-second filtering requirements are met throughout
4. **Quality Gates:** Maintain high integration standards with existing push-blaster functionality

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Direct all agents to complete their onboarding via `@push-cadence-agent-onboarding.md`
2. Execute Phase 0 checklist improvements with domain expertise application
3. Begin systematic execution through Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure & Database Foundation)

**Start Date:** 2025-08-05

### 2025-08-05: Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure & Database Foundation - IN PROGRESS
- **Feature Branch Created:** `@vercel-debugger` successfully created the `feature/push-cadence/phase-1-infra` branch to begin development.
- **Database Schema Designed:** `@notification-tracker` finalized the data model for the new Neon.tech PostgreSQL database. The core schema includes:
  - `user_notifications`: The central table for tracking every push sent to a user, indexed by `user_id`, `timestamp`, and `layer_id`.
  - `notification_layers`: A lookup table defining the 3 layers of push notifications.
  - `cadence_rules`: A configuration table to hold the parameters for our cadence logic (e.g., 72-hour cooldown).
- **Infrastructure Plan:** The foundational plan for the new microservice, including database connection pooling and basic API structure, is complete and ready for implementation.

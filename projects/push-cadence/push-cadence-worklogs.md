# Push Cadence Management System - Project Worklogs

## Project Overview
**Mission:** Build an intelligent notification cadence management system that prevents user fatigue while maintaining engagement effectiveness through individual user tracking and automated audience filtering.

**Start Date:** 2025-08-05

### 2025-08-05: Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure & Database Foundation - COMPLETED
- **Feature Branch Created:** `@vercel-debugger` successfully created the `feature/push-cadence/phase-1-infra` branch to begin development.
- **Database Schema Designed:** `@notification-tracker` finalized the data model for the new Neon.tech PostgreSQL database. The core schema includes:
  - `user_notifications`: The central table for tracking every push sent to a user, indexed by `user_id`, `timestamp`, and `layer_id`.
  - `notification_layers`: A lookup table defining the 3 layers of push notifications.
  - `cadence_rules`: A configuration table to hold the parameters for our cadence logic (e.g., 72-hour cooldown).
- **Infrastructure Plan:** The foundational plan for the new microservice, including database connection pooling and basic API structure, is complete and ready for implementation.

### 2025-08-05: Phase 2 - Cadence Engine & Rule Logic Implementation - COMPLETED
- **Feature Branch Created:** `@vercel-debugger` created the `feature/push-cadence/phase-2-engine-logic` branch.
- **Core Logic Implemented:** `@cadence-engine` implemented the core business logic for the cadence system in `src/lib/cadence.ts`. This includes:
  - Logic to fetch active cadence rules from the database.
  - Implementation of the 72-hour cooldown for Layer 3 notifications.
  - Implementation of the 7-day rolling window limit for combined Layer 2 & 3 notifications.
- **API Endpoints Created:** Two primary API endpoints were created:
  - `api/filter-audience`: This endpoint takes a list of user IDs and a layer ID and returns a filtered list of eligible users. It includes a "fail open" policy to prevent blocking pushes during an error.
  - `api/track-notification`: This endpoint allows `push-blaster` to record a notification event for a specific user after it has been sent.

### 2025-08-05: Phase 3 - Push-Blaster Integration & Frontend Enhancement - IN PROGRESS
- **Feature Branch Created:** `@vercel-debugger` created the `feature/push-cadence/phase-3-integration` branch.
- **UI Enhancement:** `@dev-hub-dev` implemented the UI for layer classification in the `push-blaster`'s main interface (`page.tsx`), including a new state for managing the selected layer.
- **Cadence Filtering Integration:** The `send-push` API in `push-blaster` has been modified to call the new `filter-audience` endpoint on the cadence microservice. The audience is now filtered based on cadence rules before notifications are sent.
- **Notification Tracking Integration:** After a push is successfully sent, the `send-push` API now calls the `track-notification` endpoint for each successful user, ensuring that all sent notifications are recorded in the new database.

**Primary Owner:** `@dev-hub-dev`
- [x] **Vercel Feature Branch:** `@vercel-debugger` to create a new feature branch for this phase.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Branch `feature/push-scheduler/phase-2-schedule-ui` created successfully.
- [x] **Push Mode Toggle:**
    - [x] Add a radio button toggle at the top of the "Make" tab: "Push Now" vs "Schedule a Push".
    - [x] When "Push Now" is selected, the UI remains exactly as it is today.
    - [x] When "Schedule a Push" is selected, modify the UI behavior as described below.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Clean radio button implementation with proper state management and conditional rendering throughout the UI.
- [x] **Audience Section Modifications (Schedule Mode):**
    - [x] In both "query push audience" and "manual audience creation" sections, replace the single "Generate Audience CSV" button with two buttons: "Save Audience Criteria" and "Generate Audience CSV".
    - [x] Implement the "Save Audience Criteria" functionality to store the current audience parameters.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Dual-button system implemented with proper state management. Audience criteria properly captured and stored for both query and manual modes.
- [x] **Push Content Section Modifications (Schedule Mode):**
    - [x] Change the section header from "Send Push Notification" to "Draft Push Notification".
    - [x] Replace the "Blast It!" button with a "Schedule It!" button.
    - [x] Keep the "Dry Run" button unchanged.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** UI modifications completed with proper conditional rendering based on push mode selection.
- [x] **Scheduling Modal:**
    - [x] When "Schedule It!" is clicked, open a modal asking for date and time.
    - [x] The modal should only work if "Save Audience Criteria" has been clicked first.
    - [x] Include "Schedule It!" and "Cancel" buttons in the modal.
    - [x] On successful scheduling, call `POST /api/scheduled-pushes` and close the modal.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Complete modal implementation with validation, error handling, and proper API integration. Future date validation included.
- [x] **Acceptance Criteria:** A user can switch to "Schedule a Push" mode, save audience criteria, and schedule a push for a future date.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Full workflow tested successfully. Users can seamlessly transition between push modes and complete the scheduling flow.
- [x] **Phase Review by the Conductor:** The conductor must systematically review the execution checklist for this phase.
- [x] **Phase Worklog Entry by the Scribe:** The scribe agent must create a worklog entry summarizing this completed phase.
- [x] **Phase GitHub commit by the @vercel-debugger:** Commit this now completed phase-branch to Github.
- [x] **Delete feature branch:** After merging, the @vercel-debugger will delete the feature branch.

## Phase 3: "Calendar" Tab Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
**Primary Owner:** `@dev-hub-dev`
- [x] **Vercel Feature Branch:** `@vercel-debugger` to create a new feature branch for this phase.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Branch `feature/push-scheduler/phase-3-calendar-tab` created successfully.
- [x] **Calendar Tab Setup:**
    - [x] Add a new "Calendar" tab to the main navigation in `page.tsx`.
    - [x] When the "Calendar" tab is clicked, it should call `GET /api/scheduled-pushes` to fetch all scheduled drafts.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Calendar tab added with automatic API call to fetch scheduled pushes. Navigation works seamlessly with existing Make/Track tabs.
- [x] **Calendar View:**
    - [x] Implement a basic monthly/weekly calendar view. A simple implementation using CSS Grid is acceptable for the initial version.
    - [x] Render the fetched push drafts as events on the calendar.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Both monthly and weekly views implemented with CSS Grid. Events display with time and title, interactive hover effects, and today highlighting.
- [x] **Push Draft Details Modal:**
    - [x] When a calendar event is clicked, open a modal displaying the details of that scheduled push.
    - [x] The modal must display:
        - The saved audience criteria (read-only).
        - The push content (title, body, deep link) in editable input fields.
    - [x] Implement a "Save Changes" button that calls `PUT /api/scheduled-pushes/:id` to update the content.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Comprehensive modal implemented with proper layout, editing capabilities, and real-time state updates after successful saves.
- [x] **On-Demand Audience & Sending Workflow:**
    - [x] Inside the modal, add a "Generate Audience CSV" button. This button will use the saved criteria to call `POST /api/query-audience`.
    - [x] After the audience is generated, reuse the existing UI components to display:
        - "Download CSV (`<count>` users)" button.
        - "Split for A/B Testing" section.
        - "Upload User ID CSV" section.
        - "Blast It!" and "Dry Run" buttons, which will call the `/api/send-push` endpoint as normal.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** Complete workflow implemented with full feature parity to main Make tab. All existing UI components properly reused with separate state management for modal context.
- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** Enhanced calendar utility functions for date management, navigation, and event filtering.
- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** Added comprehensive TypeScript typing for calendar state and modal interactions.
- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** Implemented Google Calendar-like navigation and visual design patterns.
- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** Post-send modal transformation - after successful "Blast It!" execution, modal transforms to show tracking record instead of edit interface.
- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** Calendar visual indicators - blocks change from blue (draft) to green (sent) with immediate color updates after successful push execution.
- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** Modal response isolation - success/failure messages now display within modal context instead of main app, improving UX clarity.
- [x] **IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:** API enhancement for status transitions - modified PUT endpoint to allow status updates TO 'sent' while preventing content modifications AFTER sending.
- [x] **Acceptance Criteria:** A user can view scheduled pushes on the calendar, open a draft, edit it, generate the audience on-demand, and send the push.
    ***CLOSEOUT NOTES:*** All functionality verified with 3 test scheduled pushes. Full workflow tested from calendar viewing to push sending.
- [x] **Phase Review by the Conductor:** The conductor must systematically review the execution checklist for this phase.
- [x] **Phase Worklog Entry by the Scribe:** The scribe agent must create a worklog entry summarizing this completed phase.
- [x] **Phase GitHub commit by the @vercel-debugger:** Commit this now completed phase-branch to Github.
- [ ] **Delete feature branch:** After merging, the @vercel-debugger will delete the feature branch.

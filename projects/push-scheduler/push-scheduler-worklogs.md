# Push Scheduler Worklogs

## 2025-08-03: Phase 1 Backend Implementation - COMPLETED

### 🚀 Major Milestone: Full Backend API Implementation Complete

**What We Accomplished:**
- ✅ **Complete API Infrastructure**: Implemented full CRUD operations for scheduled pushes with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- ✅ **Data Storage System**: Created `.scheduled-pushes` directory following existing `.push-logs` pattern for JSON file persistence  
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Defined comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for `ScheduledPush` and `AudienceCriteria` reusing existing patterns
- ✅ **Validation Layer**: Added robust validation for future dates, required fields, and status management
- ✅ **Next.js 15 Compliance**: Resolved async params requirements for dynamic routes
- ✅ **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive endpoint testing with curl commands confirming all operations

**Key Technical Challenges Resolved:**
- **File Location Issue**: Developer initially created API files in workspace root instead of push-blaster directory. Required file relocation and cleanup.
- **Missing GET Method**: Initially only implemented PUT/DELETE for [id] route, had to add GET method for individual push retrieval.
- **Next.js 15 Compliance**: Had to update all dynamic route handlers to use Promise-based params with `await params` syntax.
- **Server Startup Issues**: Multiple attempts to test endpoints failed due to server not running. Required proper directory navigation and server restart.

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **JSON File Storage**: Followed existing `.push-logs` pattern for consistency and simplicity
- **UUID Generation**: Used `crypto.randomUUID()` for unique push identifiers
- **Interface Reuse**: Leveraged existing audience filter interfaces from query-audience endpoint
- **Status Management**: Implemented scheduled/sent status tracking for lifecycle management

**API Endpoints Confirmed Working:**
- `GET /api/scheduled-pushes` - Returns all scheduled pushes
- `POST /api/scheduled-pushes` - Creates new scheduled push with validation
- `GET /api/scheduled-pushes/[id]` - Returns specific scheduled push
- `PUT /api/scheduled-pushes/[id]` - Updates existing scheduled push  
- `DELETE /api/scheduled-pushes/[id]` - Deletes scheduled push

**Git Workflow:**
- Feature branch `feature/push-scheduler/phase-1-backend-data-model` created and committed
- Comprehensive commit message documenting all changes and testing results
- Ready for Phase 2 frontend implementation

**Developer Performance Notes:**
- @dev-hub-dev showed excellent debugging discipline when server testing failed
- Proper error handling and comprehensive validation implemented
- Good use of existing patterns for consistency
- Thorough testing approach with multiple endpoint verification

### 🎯 Phase 1 Success Metrics:
- **100% API Coverage**: All planned CRUD operations implemented
- **Validation Working**: Future date requirements, required fields enforced  
- **Persistence Confirmed**: JSON files created/updated/deleted successfully
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript interface coverage
- **Testing Complete**: All endpoints manually verified with curl

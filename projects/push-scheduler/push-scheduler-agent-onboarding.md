Greetings Agents,

Welcome to the `push-scheduler` project.

Our mission is to evolve the `push-blaster` from a real-time tool into a strategic campaign management platform by introducing push scheduling and drafting capabilities.

Your core objectives are outlined in the **Project Brief**:
- Read `projects/push-scheduler/push-scheduler-project-brief.md`

The plan of attack is detailed in the **Execution Checklist**. This is your roadmap.
- Your primary guide is `projects/push-scheduler/push-scheduler-execution-checklist.md`

**Agent Roles:**
- **`@dev-hub-dev`**: You are the primary builder. You will lay the functional foundation for the scheduling system, from the backend API to the frontend logic. Your deep knowledge of the existing system is critical.
- **`@frontend-ui-designer`**: You are the polisher. Once the core functionality is in place, you will step in to refine the user interface and experience, ensuring the final product is not just functional but also a pleasure to use.
- **`@squad-agent-conductor`**: You are the project manager. You will keep us on track and ensure the execution checklist is followed diligently.

`@dev-hub-dev`, you are up first. Begin by reviewing the checklist and project brief, then start executing Phase 0.

Let's get to it.

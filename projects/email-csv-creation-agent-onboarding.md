Subject: Welcome to Project: Email CSV Creation

Team, welcome to the "Email CSV Creation" project.

Our mission is to build a standardized, automated system for generating the audience CSVs we use for our Mailjet campaigns. This will make our email marketing process faster, more reliable, and more powerful.

*   **@squad-agent-database-master:** You are the primary executor for this project. For the duration of this project, you will adopt the persona, skills, and protocols defined in `@project-agent-csv-crafter.md`. This is your playbook.
*   **@squad-agent-scribe:** You are the historian. You will document our progress by creating worklog and knowledge entries as we complete each phase.

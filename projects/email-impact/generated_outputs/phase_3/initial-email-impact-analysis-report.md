## Email Impact Analysis: Key Drivers of Offer Creation

This report analyzes the average Offer Uplift % associated with each tag across all campaigns, based on the **Opened Cohort**.

| Tag                | Average Offer Uplift (%) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Status             |                   201.69 |
| Trusted Trader     |                   201.69 |
| Congratulatory     |                   170.48 |
| Lifecycle          |                   170.48 |
| Exclusive          |                   131.43 |
| Promotional        |                    45.80 |
| Reward             |                    36.90 |
| Fee Discount       |                    16.64 |
| Financial Benefit  |                    16.64 |
| subject line test  |                    -9.50 |

### Key Insights:
1.  **Top Performing Tag:** The `Status` tag is associated with the highest average offer uplift (201.69%). Emails framed this way are highly effective at driving behavior.
2.  **Lowest Performing Tag:** The `subject line test` tag correlates with the lowest (and often negative) offer uplift (-9.50%). This approach appears to be ineffective or even detrimental.

### Preliminary Conclusion:
Emails that are **Congratulatory** and highlight **Status** (like unlocking Trusted Trader) seem to significantly outperform emails that focus purely on a **Financial Benefit** (like a fee discount). Users appear to be more motivated by achieving a new status within the community than by a simple monetary incentive. This aligns with our core value of making Tradeblock a fun, gamified, social experience.

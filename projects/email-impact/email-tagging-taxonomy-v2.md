## Email Tagging Taxonomy v2

This document outlines the v2 taxonomy for classifying and analyzing email campaigns based on their strategic purpose and content.

### Taxonomy Dimensions

The taxonomy is structured across six key dimensions: 

1.  **`playbook_type`**: The high-level strategic category of the email.
    *   `Lifecycle`: Sent based on a user's specific journey or milestone (e.g., welcome, activation, retention, reward).
    *   `Promotional`: A campaign focused on driving a specific, time-bound action (e.g., participating in a hot drop, using a new feature).
    *   `Transactional`: A system-triggered email confirming a user action (e.g., trade confirmation, password reset).
    *   `Product Update`: Announcing new features, changes, or improvements to the platform.
    *   `Community`: Focused on building community, sharing user-generated content, or highlighting social activity.

2.  **`topic_focus`**: The core subject matter of the email's content.
    *   `Fee Discount`: Centered on offering reduced transaction fees.
    *   `Status`: Related to user status, tiers, or recognition (e.g., Trusted Trader).
    *   `New Feature`: Highlighting a new tool or capability in the app.
    *   `Market Trend`: Sharing data or insights about what's hot in the market (e.g., trending shoes).
    *   `Shoe Spotlight`: Focusing on a specific sneaker.
    *   `Community Norms`: Addressing user behavior or platform etiquette (e.g., "DS-only" traders).
    *   `Top Hunters`: Featuring the most active users in a specific size.

3.  **`framing`**: The psychological or emotional angle used to present the message.
    *   `Congratulatory`: Celebrating a user's achievement or milestone.
    *   `Urgency`: Encouraging immediate action due to time sensitivity.
    *   `Scarcity`: Highlighting limited availability.
    *   `Social Proof`: Using the actions or success of other users to motivate.
    *   `Financial Benefit`: Explicitly stating a monetary advantage.
    *   `Exclusivity`: Making the user feel part of a special, select group.
    *   `Pain Point Agitation`: Highlighting a common frustration that our platform can solve.
    *   `Reward`: A tangible or intangible prize for a specific action or status.
    *   `Informational`: A neutral, direct presentation of information.

4.  **`personalization_level`**: The degree to which the email is tailored to the individual recipient.
    *   `Generic Broadcast`: The same message sent to a large, undifferentiated list.
    *   `Segmented`: Targeted to a specific user group based on shared attributes (e.g., all Trusted Traders).
    *   `Personalized`: Includes basic recipient-specific data (e.g., username, shoe size).
    *   `Hyper-Personalized`: Tailored based on specific, individual user behaviors (e.g., "We noticed you were looking at these shoes...").

5.  **`call_to_action`**: The primary action the email is designed to drive.
    *   `Make Offer`: Encouraging users to create a trade offer.
    *   `View Shoe`: Driving traffic to a specific shoe's page.
    *   `Explore Feature`: Prompting users to try a new feature.
    *   `Learn More`: Directing users to informational content.
    *   `Join Discussion`: Encouraging community engagement.

6.  **`test_details`**: Specifies if the campaign was part of a structured test.
    *   `Subject Line A/B Test`: An A/B test on the email's subject line.
    *   `Content A/B Test`: An A/B test on the body of the email.
    *   `Not a Test`: A standard, non-experimental campaign.

**To:** `@squad-agent-conductor`, `@data-agent-mailjet-API`, `@squad-agent-database-master`, `@project-agent-email-growth`, `@squad-agent-scribe`
**From:** `@system`
**Subject:** Mission Kickoff: From Vanity Metrics to Business Impact

## Welcome to the "Email Impact" Squad.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build the analytical engine that finally connects our email marketing efforts to what truly matters: **driving offer creation.** For too long, we've been guided by opens and clicks. Starting today, we measure what counts.

This project will be executed in three distinct, sequential blocks. Each of you has a critical role to play in your area of expertise. The quality of your work directly impacts the success of the next block in the chain.

**Your guiding document is the Project Brief:**
-   `projects/email-impact/email-impact-project-brief.md`

It contains the *why*, the *what*, and the *what done looks like*. Read it. Internalize it.

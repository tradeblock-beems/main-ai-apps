**Prepared by:** @growth-hacker
**Based on:** Initial Email Impact Analysis (July 2025)

### 1. Key Insight Recap

The analysis of past campaigns revealed a clear and powerful driver of user behavior: **Status and recognition are significantly more effective at increasing offer creation than financial incentives.** Emails celebrating a user's status (e.g., becoming a Trusted Trader) generated an average offer uplift of **+201.69%**, while emails focused on fee discounts only generated **+16.64%**.

Our path forward is clear: We must lean into making our users feel like valued, recognized members of an exclusive community.

### 2. Proposed Email Slate for the Week

This week's slate is designed to act immediately on our core insight and establish a new testing framework.

**A. New "Status-Based" Campaign: "You're a Top Hunter"**
*   **Concept:** A new, personalized email that leverages the "Who's Hunting" concept but frames it as a recognition of the recipient's status. We identify the top 5-10% most active offer creators in the last 30 days and send them an email congratulating them on being a "Top Hunter."
*   **Subject Line:** "You're one of the most active traders on Tradeblock"
*   **Body Copy Angle:** "The community has noticed. You're officially one of our Top Hunters. Your dedication to the game doesn't go unnoticed. Here are a few targets to keep the momentum going..." (followed by personalized shoe recommendations).
*   **Goal:** Validate that a pure "status" email, without any other tangible reward, can drive offer creation.

**B. A/B Test: Status vs. Financial Benefit (Clean Test)**
*   **Concept:** To get a clean signal on our core finding, we will run a direct A/B test. We'll take a single cohort of "Engaged" users (from our Propensity Tiers) who are NOT yet Trusted Traders and split them 50/50.
*   **Group A (Status Angle):**
    *   **Subject:** "Your next trade could make you a Trusted Trader"
    *   **Body:** Focuses on the benefits of becoming a TTâ€”the badge, the recognition, the community trust.
*   **Group B (Financial Angle):**
    *   **Subject:** "Save 40% on fees with your next trade"
    *   **Body:** Focuses exclusively on the financial benefit of becoming a TT.
*   **Goal:** To definitively prove, with a controlled experiment, that status is a more powerful motivator than savings for this key user segment.

**C. New Educational Campaign: "The Trade Machine Cheat Code" (Email 1 of 3)**
*   **Concept:** The first email in a 3-part series designed to drive adoption of the Trade Machine. This first email will be a simple, direct introduction to the feature.
*   **Subject Line:** "Stop searching. Start trading."
*   **Body Copy Angle:** "Tired of figuring out the perfect offer? Let the Trade Machine do the work for you. It's the fastest way to find and create deals for the shoes you want. See how it works."
*   **Goal:** To establish a baseline awareness of the Trade Machine and measure initial click-through and adoption from a broad audience.

### 3. Next Steps

1.  Build templates for the three new emails.
2.  Define the specific audience segments for each send.
3.  Deploy the campaigns and monitor performance closely.

Let's get these in front of users and continue learning.

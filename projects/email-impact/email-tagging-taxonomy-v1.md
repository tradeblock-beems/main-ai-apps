The v1 system used four main categories to classify email campaigns based on their subject lines.

### 1. Category (The "Why")
*What is the fundamental purpose of this email?*
-   **Lifecycle:** Triggered by a user's action or status change.
    -   *Examples: "Congrats–You're a Trusted Trader 👏 👟", "Trusted Trader status unlocked 👟🔥"*
-   **Promotional:** Announcing a general benefit or offer available to a segment.
    -   *Examples: "You’ve earned 40% off your trade fees", "Your Tradeblock fees just dropped by 40%"*

### 2. Topic (The "What")
*What specific subject is the email about?*
-   **Trusted Trader:** Related to the Trusted Trader program.
    -   *Examples: "Congrats–You’re a Trusted Trader 👏 👟"*

### 3. Tone (The "How")
*What is the emotional feel of the message?*
-   **Congratulatory:** Celebrating a user's achievement or new status.
    -   *Examples: "Congrats–You're a Trusted Trader 👏 👟", "You’ve earned this, Trusted Trader 👏 👟"*
-   **Exclusive:** Makes the user feel like they are part of a select group.
    -   *Examples: "You’ve earned this, Trusted Trader 👏 👟"*

### 4. Framework (The "Angle")
*What psychological angle is being used in the copy?*
-   **Reward:** You did X, so you get Y.
    -   *Examples: "You’ve earned 40% off your trade fees"*

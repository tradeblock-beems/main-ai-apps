# Worklogs: Email Impact Project

This file will store the structured worklog entries generated by `@squad-agent-scribe` at the completion of each phase of the project. 

### Phase 0: Project Initialization and Alignment
- Project was kicked off, but the `@squad-agent-conductor` identified an immediate ambiguity in the agent roster. The kickoff prompt listed different agents (`@data-agent-mailjet-API`, `@project-agent-email-growth`) than those generated in the starter pack (`@mailjet-data`, `@growth-hacker`).
- A clear decision was made to proceed with the global/existing agents, establishing the official team roster.
- The conductor confirmed the obsolete, project-specific agent rule files were deleted, ensuring a clean and unambiguous project structure.
- Key project documents, including `email-impact-execution-checklist.md` and `email-impact-agent-onboarding.md`, were systematically updated to reflect the correct agent roster.
- The `@squad-agent-conductor` checked out the `feature/email-impact/phase-0` branch and marked the initial setup and alignment tasks as complete, officially concluding the setup phase and preparing for substantive work. 

### Phase 1: Mailjet Data Extraction & Cleansing
- The phase began with `@data-agent-mailjet-API` taking ownership under the `feature/email-impact/phase-1` branch, created by the `@squad-agent-conductor`.
- **Initial Blocker & Architect Intervention:** The data agent was initially blocked, requesting API credentials directly in the chat. The `@squad-agent-architect` intervened, enforcing the standard procedure of not passing secrets directly. The architect guided the agent to add the Mailjet keys to a `.env` file and update the central `config.py` to load them securely.
- **Iterative Script Development:** The `@data-agent-mailjet-API` created the `phase_1_mailjet_extraction.py` script. The script underwent several user-driven improvements:
    - A `tqdm` progress bar was added for better visibility during long-running API calls.
    - A `ModuleNotFoundError` was resolved by correctly adding the project's root directory to the system path (`sys.path`).
- **Performance & Reliability Enhancements:**
    - To accelerate data extraction, the script was refactored to use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel API calls, achieving a ~10x performance improvement which was verified with testing.
    - To improve fault tolerance, a local caching mechanism was implemented. The initial list of all messages is saved to a file, allowing the script to resume without re-fetching everything if it fails mid-process.
- **Execution & Verification:** The final, robust script was executed successfully. The agent verified the output files, confirming that the raw data reports and recipient action CSVs were generated correctly for each campaign.
- **Phase Closeout:** The `@squad-agent-conductor` reviewed the phase, updating the execution checklist with detailed notes on the technical improvements and challenges encountered after an initial misstep where the notes were added to the chat instead of the file.

### Phase 2: Offer Uplift Analysis
- The `@squad-agent-database-master` took control to begin the analysis phase. The initial step was to locate and inspect the CSV files generated in Phase 1.
- **Initial Script & Critical Performance Flaw:** An analysis script (`phase_2_offer_uplift_analysis.py`) was created. However, the user identified a major performance bottleneck: the script was designed to query the database for *each individual user* in every campaign, an N+1 problem that would have taken days to complete.
- **User-Directed Pivot to Cohort Analysis:** The user intervened, directing the agent to abandon the per-user approach in favor of a much more efficient cohort-based analysis. The new goal was to query the total offer activity for three distinct groups: users who received, opened, and clicked each email.
- **Iterative Refinement:**
    - The original script was deleted to avoid confusion.
    - A new script, `phase_2_offer_uplift_analysis_v2.py`, was created.
    - The GraphQL query function was rewritten to accept a list of user IDs and use the `_in` operator, allowing it to fetch data for an entire cohort in a single database call.
    - The script was updated to build the three user cohorts (received, opened, clicked) for each campaign.
- **Output Enhancement:** Based on further user feedback, the output format for the `impact-summary.txt` files was improved to include both raw cohort-level daily averages and per-user averages, providing richer context. The formatting was also adjusted for better readability.
- **Final Execution:** After a final cleanup of the output directory, the optimized script was run, successfully processing all 60 campaigns in under five minutesâ€”a dramatic validation of the new approach.
- **Phase Closeout:** The `@squad-agent-conductor` reviewed the phase, documenting the critical pivot in strategy and the iterative improvements in the execution checklist.

@squad-agent-conductor, @squad-agent-database-master, @squad-agent-scribe

We are kicking off the **"Email CSV Creation"** project.

The goal is to build a system for generating Mailjet audience CSVs. All project documentation has been created in the `/projects/email-csv-creation/` directory.

@squad-agent-conductor, you are the designated project manager. Please begin by directing the `@squad-agent-database-master` to their onboarding script to start execution.

Onboarding script: `projects/email-csv-creation/email-csv-creation-agent-onboarding.md`

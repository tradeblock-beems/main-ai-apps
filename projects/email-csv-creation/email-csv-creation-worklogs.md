# Worklogs for Project: Email CSV Creation

*This file will be populated by the @squad-agent-scribe at the completion of each phase of the project.* 

---

### Phase 0: Project Setup & Execution Plan Refinement

- The "Email CSV Creation" project was initiated. @squad-agent-conductor delegated execution to @squad-agent-database-master.
- @squad-agent-database-master onboarded by reviewing the project brief, onboarding script, and adopted the specialized persona of the `CSV Crafter`.
- As the CSV Crafter, the agent reviewed the initial execution checklist and identified opportunities for improvement based on the `technical-standard-approaches.md` document.
- The checklist was significantly updated to enforce a modular structure, mandating that all reusable queries be built in a central `email_csv_queries.py` file within the `basic_capabilities` directory.
- The checklist was also updated to incorporate the standard Git workflow, with new tasks added to each phase for creating a feature branch at the start and committing the work at the end, ensuring the scribe documents the work before the final commit.
- @squad-agent-conductor reviewed and approved the refined execution plan, officially marking the planning portion of Phase 0 as complete.

### Phase 1: Audience Query Development
- @db-master began implementing the `get_audience` function in `email_csv_queries.py`.
- A recurring syntax error was encountered while trying to filter users based on the count of their inventory items (`inventory_aggregate`) directly within the GraphQL query.
- After three unsuccessful attempts to fix the linter error related to the `gql` query structure, the effort was paused.
- **Decision:** The current approach of using a complex, nested filter in GraphQL is proving difficult. A new strategy is needed. The two primary hypotheses are: 1) The GraphQL syntax is incorrect and requires further research into Hasura's specific implementation for aggregate filters, or 2) This specific type of query is better suited for raw SQL, where the joins and counts can be expressed more directly.
- **Next Step:** @db-master will re-evaluate the approach, starting with an attempt to write the logic as a direct SQL query.

### Phase 1: Audience Query Implementation
- After re-evaluating the approach, @db-master proceeded to implement the `get_audience` function using a direct SQL query.
- The agent explicitly used the "Tradeblock data model and database query guide" to construct a robust, multi-CTE (Common Table Expression) query.
- This new SQL-based approach successfully joined `users`, `user_activities`, `inventory_items`, and preference tables to meet all filtering and data requirements.
- The new function was validated with a temporary test script (`test_audience_query.py`), which ran multiple test cases, including edge cases, and confirmed the function's correctness.
- The test script was deleted after use, and all development tasks for the phase were marked as complete. The first building block is now ready for use. 

### Phase 2: Product-Level Query Implementation
- @db-master began implementing the `get_products_by_ids` function with a complex, single SQL query.
- Initial testing revealed a significant server-side error: `could not write to file... No space left on device`. This indicated that the query was too resource-intensive for the database's temporary storage.
- After re-consulting the data model guide, @db-master diagnosed the issue as a need for better query optimization, specifically by filtering data *before* joining.
- The agent re-architected the query using a multi-CTE (Common Table Expression) approach. Each statistic was calculated in its own CTE on a pre-filtered dataset. These small, aggregated CTEs were then joined together.
- This new, optimized query ran successfully, completing in a fraction of the time and resolving the database resource error.
- The learning was codified by updating the `squad-agent-database-master.mdc` rules file with a new best practice for using pre-aggregated CTEs for complex statistical queries.
- The development tasks were completed, and the building block is now ready.

### Phase 3: Building Block - Variant-Level Query
- **Initial Goal & Pivot:** The phase began with creating a function to get variant data based on a list of `variant_ids`. The user intervened to clarify that the function should be more powerful, accepting `product_ids` instead and fanning out to find all associated variants. The `@db-master` successfully re-architected the function and the underlying SQL query to match this more useful requirement.
- **Debugging Journey - `TypeError`:** The first test run after the pivot failed with a `TypeError`. The `@db-master` correctly hypothesized that the database utility (`sql_utils.py`) was returning results as tuples instead of dictionary-like objects.
- **In-Flight Improvement:** To fix this, the `@db-master` made a significant, unplanned improvement, modifying `sql_utils.py` to use `psycopg2.extras.RealDictCursor`. This ensures all future database queries will return more intuitive dictionary-like rows, a benefit for the entire system.
- **Debugging Journey - Logical Error:** The next test run executed without error but revealed a subtle data bug: the `total_offers_to_get` and `total_offers_to_give` columns were always zero.
- **Systematic Debugging:** The `@db-master` followed a methodical process to solve this:
    1.  Created a temporary analysis script to confirm the issue was isolated to those two columns.
    2.  Hypothesized the `WHERE` clause filter `o.offer_status = 'PENDING'` was the cause.
    3.  Queried the `offer_statuses` table directly to get the ground truth for valid statuses.
    4.  Discovered the correct status for an active offer is `'OPEN'`, not `'PENDING'`.
- **Knowledge Capture:** The list of valid `offer_status` values was added to the `@db-master`'s knowledge file (`squad-agent-database-master.mdc`) to prevent this error in the future.
- **Procedural Correction:** The user pointed out that the `@conductor` had performed the end-of-phase git operations *before* the phase review was complete, violating the checklist order.
- **In-Flight Process Improvement:** In response, the `@conductor`'s core rules (`squad-agent-conductor.mdc`) were updated to mandate consulting the checklist before any action. Furthermore, the "Phase Review" task in the project checklist was expanded with a more detailed and rigorous set of instructions for all future phases to ensure proper oversight.
- **Phase Completion:** After the procedural corrections, the conductor properly completed the phase review and git workflow, merging the `feature/email-csv-creation/phase-3-variant-query` branch into `main` and deleting the branch.

### Phase 4: Email Script - Single Shoe Feature
- **Summary:** This was a marathon phase focused on creating the `generate_single_shoe_feature_csv.py` script. The process involved a significant, multi-layered debugging effort that ultimately led to a much deeper understanding of our database and a more robust final script.
- **Initial Development:** @db-master created the initial script, importing the query functions from the previous phases and using `argparse` to accept a `productID` and audience parameters.
- **Debugging Cascade:** The first execution kicked off a cascade of errors and logical bugs:
    - **Empty CSV:** The script ran but produced an empty file. Diagnostics revealed the audience query was returning zero users.
    - **Fundamental Audience Logic Flaw:** The user intervened to clarify a core misunderstanding. The audience query was incorrectly tied to the specific product. The agent was guided to refactor the logic entirely, making the audience query generic and based on user activity, completely independent of the product.
    - **String vs. Float:** A subtle bug was discovered where shoe sizes were being compared as strings (`'10.0'`) instead of floats (`10.0`), causing mismatches. This was resolved by casting sizes correctly.
    - **The Root Cause:** After fixing the above, the audience query *still* returned zero users. By stripping the query down to its absolute simplest form (`SELECT id FROM users...`), the agent finally uncovered the root cause that had plagued the entire project: the query was filtering for `deleted_at IS NULL`, but our schema uses **`deleted_at = 0`** for active users.
- **Final Fixes & Success:**
    - With the `deleted_at` filter corrected, the query finally returned users.
    - The full query logic was methodically rebuilt.
    - A final bug involving missing `email` and `firstname` columns was fixed by adding the correct SQL aliases (`u.email`, `u.firstname`).
    - The final test run was successful, producing a correctly populated CSV matching the example file's structure.
- **Phase Review:** @conductor reviewed the extensive work, updating the execution checklist with detailed notes to capture the key learnings from the debugging process.

### Phase 5: Email Script - Trending Shoes
- **Summary:** This phase successfully delivered the `generate_trending_shoes_csv.py` script. The process was a model of efficiency, directly building upon the architecture and, more importantly, the learnings from the previous phase.
- **Efficient Development:** @db-master began by copying the `generate_hot_drop_csv.py` script and adapting it. The argument parser and data transformation logic were updated to handle three product IDs, aligning with the `trending-shoes-07012025.csv` example.
- **Accelerated Debugging:** The initial test run produced a "silent failure" (an empty CSV), the same issue that caused significant delays in Phase 4. However, armed with the knowledge from that experience, the agent immediately hypothesized the cause: a missing `product_id` in the `get_variants_by_product_ids` query output.
- **Rapid Resolution:** The agent added a diagnostic print statement to confirm the hypothesis, identified the missing field, corrected the SQL query in `email_csv_queries.py`, and re-ran the script. The second run was successful, generating a fully populated CSV.
- **Knowledge in Action:** This phase serves as a powerful example of our learning system at work. The pain points of Phase 4 directly led to a rapid, almost instantaneous resolution of a similar problem in Phase 5, proving the value of capturing and reapplying knowledge.
- **Verification:** @conductor verified that the generated CSV's header perfectly matched the example file, confirming the script's correctness.

------------------------------------

### Phase 0: Top Prospects Email - Project Initiation and Plan Refinement
- Project kicked off to generate a CSV for a new "Top Prospects" email campaign.
- @squad-agent-database-master was onboarded and assigned as the primary agent for script development.
- The agent reviewed the initial execution checklist and proposed several key improvements for clarity and robustness.
- Key refinements included: adding an explicit task for code reuse analysis, clarifying the SQL logic to define the "top target shoe" as the most recently added `desired_item`, and adding error handling for users with empty wishlists.
- The standard end-of-phase review, commit, and cleanup tasks were also added to the Phase 0 checklist itself to ensure disciplined project management.
- The execution checklist was updated with these changes, and the initial review tasks for Phase 0 were marked as complete.

------------------------------------

### Phase 1: Top Prospects Email - Script Scaffolding & Data Ingestion
- @squad-agent-architect created the feature branch `feature/top-prospects-email/phase-1-script-scaffolding`.
- @squad-agent-database-master analyzed existing scripts in `basic_capabilities` and determined that creating a new, more targeted function for fetching user data by a list of IDs would be more efficient than adapting existing audience-wide functions.
- The new script file, `generate_top_prospects_csv.py`, was created.
- Boilerplate code was added, including argument parsing for input/output files and placeholder imports for the database functions to be created in the next phase.
- The `read_user_ids` function was implemented and integrated into the script's `main` function to handle the ingestion of the target user list from the input CSV.
- @squad-agent-conductor reviewed the completed work and approved the phase for closeout.

------------------------------------

### Phase 2: Top Prospects Email - Schema Discovery and Core Logic
- The phase began with a critical pivot. Instead of assuming the `desired_items` table structure, the user directed `@squad-agent-database-master` to first perform schema exploration.
- A temporary script was created to run a `SELECT * LIMIT 10` query, which successfully revealed the table's structure.
- This exploration uncovered the `offers_count` column, a much better proxy for user desire than the initially planned `created_at` timestamp. This became the core metric for the query.
- The DB Master also updated its own rules to codify this `SELECT *` discovery technique as a standard practice for future schema explorations.
- With a clear understanding of the data, two new reusable functions, `get_user_data_by_ids` and `get_top_target_shoe_for_users`, were created and added to the `email_csv_queries.py` toolbox.
- The main script was updated to use these new functions and handle edge cases for users with missing data.
- @squad-agent-conductor conducted a thorough phase review, adding detailed `***CLOSEOUT NOTES:***` to each completed task directly in the checklist—a practice that was then codified into the Conductor's own rules for future projects.

## 1. Subject Lines & Preview Text: The Rule of Three

For every new email campaign, always generate **three distinct versions** of the subject line and corresponding preview text for A/B/C testing. This allows us to continuously learn and refine our approach based on what resonates with our audience.

The goal is to test different psychological triggers or angles. While the specific approach will vary, here are some proven frameworks to consider for your variants:

*   **The Status Angle:** Leads with exclusivity, recognition, or community standing (e.g., `A Top Prospect's guide to...`).
*   **The Intrigue Angle:** Piques curiosity by hinting at a solution or benefit without revealing everything (e.g., `That trade is closer than you think...`).
*   **The Explicit Angle:** Clearly and directly states the primary offer or benefit (e.g., `We'll cover the shipping for your...`).

### Tactical Rules for Subject Lines:
-   **Dynamic Content Placement:** Any dynamic or potentially long content (e.g., shoe names, usernames) **must** be placed at the end of the subject line. This prevents it from truncating the core message on mobile devices.
-   **Unique Preview Text:** Each subject line variant should be paired with its own unique preview text that complements and enhances the subject.

## 2. Effective Narrative & Framing Strategies

The narrative framing of an email is critical. There is no single "correct" story for every campaign, but certain strategies have proven to be highly effective. Consider these when crafting your email.

### Strategy: Frame Around Status & Recognition
Our data has shown that making users feel seen and valued is a powerful motivator.
-   **Lead with Status:** Consider opening the email by establishing *why* the user is receiving this message, framing it as a result of their specific status or activity.
-   **Create Exclusive Personas:** When targeting user segments, it can be effective to "brand" them with a status (e.g., "Top Prospect," "Heavy Hitter"). This transforms a generic marketing email into an exclusive communication.
-   **Re-frame Incentives:** Financial benefits can be made more powerful when presented as earned rewards or special "assists" that are unlocked by the user's status.

## 3. Email Structure: Foundational Best Practices

-   **Introduce the Incentive Early:** If the email contains a key offer (like free shipping), it should be mentioned in the introductory paragraph. Don't risk users missing the offer by burying it at the bottom of the email.
-   **Provide Educational Content:** If an email's call-to-action involves a complex or underutilized feature, include a dedicated section with tips on how to use it effectively. This preempts user frustration and improves feature adoption.
-   **Use Social Proof:** When applicable, embed social proof like videos or testimonials from influencers or other users. This builds trust and demonstrates the value of the feature or offer in a real-world context.

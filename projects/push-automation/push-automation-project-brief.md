# Push Automation Project Brief

## Strategic Overview
Transform the push-blaster tool from a manual notification system into a comprehensive automation platform that enables sophisticated push notification campaigns while maintaining safety and user control. This builds directly on the existing push-blaster and push-cadence-service infrastructure.

## Business Context
Currently, push notifications require manual execution even when scheduled, limiting our ability to run consistent onboarding funnels, retention campaigns, and other automated sequences. This manual overhead prevents us from implementing data-driven notification strategies that could significantly improve user engagement and platform adoption.

The user has specifically requested a daily onboarding funnel with 6 sequential pushes that target different user engagement states (add to closet → create offer → complete profile → add to wishlist), with automated audience generation 30 minutes before execution and a cancellation window.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Universal Automation Engine**: Build a foundational automation system that can handle any type of push notification campaign
2. **New User Onboarding Automation**: Enable automated 6-push onboarding sequences that run daily without manual intervention
3. **True Scheduled Execution**: Convert existing calendar scheduling from "draft creation" to actual automated sending
4. **Template-Based Campaign Creation**: Provide reusable templates for different automation types (onboarding, retention, reactivation)

### Secondary Objectives
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing push-blaster functionality
- Implement comprehensive safety protocols and testing workflows
- Create foundation for future automation types (triggered, event-based, etc.)
- Enable easy creation and management of complex multi-step campaigns

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing push-blaster and push-cadence-service architecture
- Use cron-based scheduling (no external job queue systems)
- Maintain existing Layer 0-4 notification cadence rules
- Production deployment with safeguards (no separate staging environment)
- 30-minute lead time for audience generation and test validation
- Leverage existing unified service architecture (both services on same server, different ports)

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (Phase 1-3)
- [ ] Existing scheduled pushes automatically execute at their scheduled time
- [ ] Universal automation data model supports multiple campaign types
- [ ] Cron scheduler reliably executes automations with proper timing
- [ ] Comprehensive safety protocols prevent accidental mass notifications

### Campaign Success (Phase 4-5)
- [ ] 6-push onboarding funnel runs daily with automated audience generation
- [ ] Test pushes sent 25 minutes before live execution with cancellation window
- [ ] Template system allows easy creation of new automation types
- [ ] Real-time monitoring and cancellation capabilities

### Platform Success (Phase 6+)
- [ ] Foundation supports triggered automations, A/B testing, and advanced analytics
- [ ] Non-technical users can create and manage complex campaigns
- [ ] System scales to handle multiple concurrent automation sequences
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging and performance monitoring

## Risk Mitigation
- **User Safety**: Multiple layers of testing, audience size limits, and emergency stop capabilities
- **System Reliability**: Cron-based execution with failure recovery and monitoring
- **Backward Compatibility**: Migration strategy for existing scheduled pushes
- **Development Safety**: Incremental rollout with comprehensive testing at each phase
- **Integration Risk**: Leverage existing push-blaster expertise and architecture patterns

## Timeline
- **Weeks 1-2**: Universal automation foundation and backend engine
- **Weeks 3-4**: Sequence execution and UI integration
- **Week 5**: Onboarding funnel implementation and testing
- **Week 6+**: Advanced features and template expansion

This project establishes the automation foundation that will power notification campaigns for years to come, building directly on the robust push-blaster and push-cadence infrastructure already in place.

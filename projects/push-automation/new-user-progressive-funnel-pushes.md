## 🌟 Audience 1: New Stars
**Who:** New users who have already created trade offers (~41 users, 10.5% of base)  
**Goal:** Help them close their first deal and become addicted to trading

### Push Notification
- **Title:** "🏆 Your [Target Shoe] hunter"
- **Body:** "Built the perfect trap for those [Target Shoe]s. Deploy? →"
- **URL:** `[offer generator for target shoe]`

**Psychology:** Frames the offer generator as a "trap" they've "built" - making them feel clever and in control. "Deploy?" creates anticipation like they're launching a mission.

---

## 🎯 Audience 2: New Prospects  
**Who:** New users with identifiable target shoes but no offers yet (~108 users, 27.8% of base)  
**Goal:** Convert them by making offer creation feel inevitable

### Push Notification
- **Title:** "🎯 [Target Shoe] coordinates"
- **Body:** "Intel: [X] pairs in circulation. Time to strike →"
- **URL:** `[offer generator for top target shoe]`

**Psychology:** Military/heist language ("coordinates," "intel," "strike") makes offer creation feel strategic and exciting. Provides real data to justify action.

---

## 👟 Audience 5: No Shoe Added
**Who:** New users who haven't added any items to their closet yet (~241 users, 62.0% of base)  
**Goal:** Get them addicted to seeing demand for their shoes

### Push Notification (WOW FACTOR)
- **Title:** "💰 Your closet is broke rn"
- **Body:** "No shoes = no offers = no trades. Fix that →"
- **URL:** `[add to closet flow]`

**Psychology:** Direct callout using their language ("broke," "rn"). Creates immediate problem awareness and positions adding shoes as the obvious fix. Bold enough to grab attention.

---

## 🚀 Audience 7: No Offers Created
**Who:** New users with closet items who haven't created offers (~108 users, 27.8% of base)  
**Goal:** Make them realize they're leaving money on the table

### Push Notification
- **Title:** "🤔 Why you not trading yet?"
- **Body:** "Got the shoes. Know the value. Missing offers? →"
- **URL:** `[offer creation flow]`

**Psychology:** Direct question challenges them. "Got the shoes. Know the value." acknowledges their progress but highlights the gap. Conversational tone feels like a friend asking.

---

## 👤 Audience 9: Profile Incomplete
**Who:** New users (offer creators) with incomplete profiles (~22 users, 5.7% of base)  
**Goal:** Make profile completion feel like gaining an unfair advantage

### Push Notification (WOW FACTOR)
- **Title:** "🥷 Go from ghost to trader"
- **Body:** "No face, no bio = sus. Get trusted status →"
- **URL:** `[profile completion flow]`

**Psychology:** "Ghost to trader" transformation narrative. "Sus" uses Gen Z language authentically. Frames incomplete profile as a liability holding them back from "trusted status."

---

## Alternative High-Impact Variants

### No Shoe Added (Social Proof Angle)
- **Title:** "🚨 Everyone's watching empty"
- **Body:** "0 shoes = 0 offers = 0 respect. Change that →"
- **URL:** `[add to closet flow]`

### No Offers Created (FOMO Angle)  
- **Title:** "⏰ While you wait, others win"
- **Body:** "Your shoes. Their offers. Your loss. Go get 'em →"
- **URL:** `[offer creation flow]`

### Profile Incomplete (Street Cred Angle)
- **Title:** "📸 Anonymous = amateur"
- **Body:** "Real traders show face. Complete the look →"
- **URL:** `[profile completion flow]`

## 🎯 Why These Work

**Cultural Fluency:** Uses language actual sneakerheads use ("broke," "sus," "go get 'em")  
**Psychological Triggers:** Loss aversion, social proof, status anxiety  
**Problem/Solution:** Creates immediate pain awareness, positions action as relief  
**Authentic Urgency:** Based on real social dynamics, not fake scarcity  

**The "Wow" Elements:**
1. **"Your closet is broke rn"** - Brutally direct, culturally authentic
2. **"Go from ghost to trader"** - Powerful transformation narrative
3. **"Built the perfect trap"** - Makes user feel clever/strategic

These aren't just pushes. They're conversion weapons.

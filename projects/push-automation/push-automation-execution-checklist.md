# Push Automation Execution Checklist

## Phase 0: Execution Checklist Improvement
**Primary Owner:** `@dev-hub-dev`

- [ ] Complete agent onboarding and digest project brief thoroughly
- [ ] Review existing push-blaster and push-cadence-service architecture (as original creator)
- [ ] Analyze current scheduling system and identify optimal integration points

- [ ] Coordinate with @automation-orchestrator on architecture approach
- [ ] **Phase Review by the Conductor:** The conductor must systematically review the execution checklist for this phase. This includes: marking all completed tasks, appending notes to checklist items about key challenges or learnings encountered, and documenting any undocumented deviations by creating a new checked-off checklist item starting with `IN-FLIGHT ADDITION:` to clearly flag tasks that were performed but not planned.
- [ ] **Phase Worklog Entry by the Scribe:** The scribe agent must create a worklog entry summarizing this completed phase. (The scribe already knows the format, style, and destination for these worklog entries.)

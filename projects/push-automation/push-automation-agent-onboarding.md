# Push Automation Agent Onboarding

Welcome to the push automation project team! You're joining a strategic initiative to transform our push notification system from manual execution to sophisticated automation platform.

## Mission Context
We're building a universal automation engine that will serve as the foundation for all future push notification campaigns. This isn't just about automating one workflow - we're creating the platform that will power onboarding funnels, retention campaigns, reactivation sequences, and any future notification automation needs.

## Your Role

**@dev-hub-dev**: You're the project lead and technical architect responsible for the entire automation system. As the original creator of push-blaster and push-cadence-service, your deep knowledge of the existing infrastructure is crucial for building automation that integrates seamlessly and leverages existing patterns.

**@automation-orchestrator**: You're the automation specialist supporting @dev-hub-dev with advanced workflow orchestration, cron scheduling, and template systems. Your expertise in automation patterns and safety protocols will ensure we build a robust, extensible platform.

## Strategic Context
This project represents a significant step toward our goal of AI-driven, automated user engagement. The automation platform you build will:
- Enable consistent onboarding experiences that improve user activation
- Allow data-driven retention campaigns that reduce churn
- Provide the foundation for future AI-powered personalization
- Free up manual effort for higher-value strategic work

## Key Success Metrics
- **Reliability**: Automations execute flawlessly with comprehensive safety protocols
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing push-blaster and push-cadence infrastructure
- **Usability**: Non-technical users can create and manage complex campaigns
- **Extensibility**: New automation types can be added through templates, not code changes
- **Safety**: Multiple layers of protection prevent accidental mass notifications

## Required Reading
1. **`@push-automation-project-brief.md`** - Strategic overview and business context
2. **`@push-blaster-dependencies.md`** - Existing system architecture and integration points
3. **Current push-blaster codebase** - Understanding existing scheduling and execution systems
4. **Push-cadence-service implementation** - Layer-based notification rules and safety systems

## Technical Considerations
- Build on existing push-blaster architecture patterns, don't reinvent
- Leverage existing unified service architecture (both services running together)
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility with current scheduling system
- Use existing Layer 0-4 cadence rules for user safety
- Design for template-based extensibility from day one
- Implement comprehensive testing and emergency stop capabilities
- Integrate with existing GraphQL infrastructure for audience queries

## Collaboration Protocol
- **@dev-hub-dev leads all phases** - Primary ownership of architecture and integration decisions
- **@automation-orchestrator provides specialized support** - Focus on cron scheduling, workflow orchestration, and template systems
- **Safety-first approach** - All automation features must include safeguards and testing
- **Documentation as you go** - Capture decisions and learnings for future automation projects
- **Leverage existing patterns** - Build on proven push-blaster and push-cadence patterns

## Existing Infrastructure Assets
- **Push-blaster**: Complete UI, API routes, audience generation, and push sending infrastructure
- **Push-cadence-service**: Layer-based filtering, user notification tracking, safety protocols
- **Unified startup**: Both services running together via concurrently
- **GraphQL integration**: Audience queries and data enrichment
- **JSON storage**: Proven pattern for scheduling data storage
- **Calendar UI**: Existing scheduling interface to build upon

## Project Timeline
This is a 6-week project with clear phases. Week 1-2 focus on foundation, weeks 3-4 on execution and UI, week 5 on the onboarding funnel, and week 6 on advanced features.

**Your immediate next step**: Review the execution checklist and begin Phase 0 by scrutinizing and improving the project plan based on your deep push-blaster expertise.

Now begin executing against the execution checklist. Build an automation platform that leverages everything we've already built and serves us for years to come!

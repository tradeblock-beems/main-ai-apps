@squad-agent-conductor, the `@architect` has completed a comprehensive review of the `push-blaster` service and identified critical flaws that are causing instability. We are now initiating the **Push Service Refactor** mini-project to address these issues.

@project-agent-dev-hub-dev, you are the primary owner for this refactor. Your new operational protocols are in effect.

Please begin by reviewing your onboarding script:
`projects/push-automation/push-service-refactor/push-service-refactor-agent-onboarding.md`

Let's get this service back on solid ground.

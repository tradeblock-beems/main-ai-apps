# Onboarding Script: @project-agent-dev-hub-dev

Welcome to the **Push Service Refactor** mini-project.

Your mission is to stabilize the `push-blaster` service by resolving a set of critical, well-documented architectural flaws. This is a surgical operation aimed at eliminating the root causes of our recent build failures and instability.

Your primary guide for this project is the `push-automation-system-review.md` file, which contains the `@architect`'s deep analysis of the system. Your recently updated rules require you to consult this document before making any changes.

Start by reading the project brief to re-acquaint yourself with the specific objectives:
- `projects/push-automation/push-service-refactor/push-service-refactor-project-brief.md`

Your execution plan is laid out in the checklist. Now begin executing against the `push-service-refactor-execution-checklist.md`.

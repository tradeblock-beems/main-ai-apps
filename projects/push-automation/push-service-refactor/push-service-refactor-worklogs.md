### Phase 0: Execution Checklist Improvement
- **Timestamp:** 2025-08-24 11:30:00 PM
- The `push-service-refactor` mini-project was initiated to address critical stability issues in the `push-blaster` service.
- `@project-agent-dev-hub-dev`, as the primary owner, reviewed the initial high-level objectives.
- The agent successfully broke down the objectives for all four phases into a granular, actionable set of sub-tasks, updating the `push-service-refactor-execution-checklist.md` with this detailed plan.
- `@squad-agent-architect` reviewed the refined checklist and confirmed that the technical approach is sound and aligns with the architectural goals.
- With the architect's approval, `@squad-agent-conductor` has officially closed out Phase 0. The project now moves to active implementation.

### Phase 1: Unify Type Definitions (UI Layer)
- **Timestamp:** 2025-08-24 11:45:00 PM
- `@project-agent-dev-hub-dev` initiated Phase 1, focusing on eliminating a critical architectural flaw in the UI layer.
- The agent successfully refactored the `edit-automation` page, removing its local, outdated `Automation` interface and replacing it with the canonical `UniversalAutomation` type.
- This initial fix unexpectedly revealed a cascade of deeper, pre-existing build errors.
- **In-flight Addition:** The `@architect` intervened to resolve a systemic issue across all API routes where the `AutomationEngine` singleton was being imported incorrectly.
- **In-flight Addition:** The `@dev-hub-dev` performed several additional refactors on the `edit-automation` page to resolve newly surfaced type errors that were previously masked.
- The phase concluded with a successful `npm run build`, confirming that all type-related build errors have been resolved and the acceptance criteria are met.
- `@squad-agent-conductor` has officially closed out Phase 1, marking a significant step toward stabilizing the application.

### Phase 2: Eliminate Unsafe Type Casting (Core Engine)
- **Timestamp:** 2025-08-24 11:50:00 PM
- `@project-agent-dev-hub-dev` executed Phase 2, focusing on hardening the `automationEngine` against corrupted or malformed automation files.
- The agent refactored the `restoreActiveAutomations` function, removing the unsafe `(automation as any)` type casts.
- A new type-safe validation check was implemented to ensure that automation objects loaded from JSON files have the necessary `isActive` and `status` properties before being processed.
- Error logging was added to warn developers if an invalid automation file is encountered during startup.
- This change makes the core engine more resilient and prevents legacy or corrupted data from causing runtime errors.
- `@squad-agent-conductor` has officially closed out Phase 2.

### Phase 3: Stabilize File Pathing (Storage & Scripting Layers)
- **Timestamp:** 2025-08-24 11:55:00 PM
- `@project-agent-dev-hub-dev` executed Phase 3, addressing the critical pathing fragility identified in the architectural review.
- The agent refactored `automationStorage.ts`, replacing its dependency on `process.cwd()` with a stable path resolution method (`path.resolve`) to ensure the `.automations` directory is always correctly located.
- The agent also refactored `scriptExecutor.ts`, applying the same stable pathing logic to the Python scripts directory, the script outputs directory, and the critical `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
- These changes ensure that the application's file I/O operations are resilient and no longer dependent on the directory from which the server process is launched.
- `@squad-agent-conductor` has officially closed out Phase 3.

### Phase 4: Final Validation and Local Server Startup
- **Timestamp:** 2025-08-25 12:00:00 AM
- `@project-agent-dev-hub-dev` initiated the final phase of the refactor.
- After a series of cascading build failures, the `@architect` provided a final, definitive fix for a systemic pathing issue that was causing runtime errors.
- With the pathing issue resolved, the application built successfully.
- The `@dev-hub-dev` executed the server startup protocol, and the `push-blaster` application started successfully on `localhost:3001`.
- Log verification confirmed a clean startup with a single `AutomationEngine` instance.
- A final smoke test confirmed that the UI is accessible and functional.
- All acceptance criteria for the project have been met. The service is now stable and running locally.
- `@squad-agent-conductor` has officially closed out the project.

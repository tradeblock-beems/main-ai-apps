# Push Automation Project Kickoff

## Project Introduction
Welcome to the push automation project! We're building a universal automation engine that will transform how we handle push notifications - from manual execution to sophisticated, template-based campaigns that run automatically.

## Team Assembly
This project brings together specialized agents with complementary expertise:

**@dev-hub-dev** - Project lead and original architect of push-blaster and push-cadence-service. Responsible for overall automation architecture, UI integration, and ensuring seamless integration with existing infrastructure.

**@automation-orchestrator** - Automation specialist focusing on workflow orchestration, cron scheduling, template systems, and safety protocols. Provides specialized support for complex automation patterns.

**@squad-agent-conductor** - Project manager overseeing execution flow, phase coordination, and ensuring deliverables meet success criteria.

**@squad-agent-vercel-debugger** - Deployment and branch management specialist ensuring proper Git workflow and deployment safety.

**@squad-agent-scribe** - Documentation specialist capturing progress, decisions, and learnings throughout the project lifecycle.

## Strategic Context
This project establishes the automation foundation for all future push notification campaigns. We're not just solving the immediate need for onboarding automation - we're building the platform that will power retention campaigns, reactivation sequences, and any future automated engagement strategies.

The user has specifically requested:
- Daily onboarding funnel with 6 sequential pushes
- Automated audience generation 30 minutes before execution
- Test pushes with cancellation window
- Universal foundation for future automation types

## Technical Foundation
We're building on robust existing infrastructure:
- **Push-blaster**: Complete notification system with UI, APIs, and audience generation
- **Push-cadence-service**: Layer-based filtering and user safety protocols
- **Unified architecture**: Both services running together for seamless integration
- **Proven patterns**: JSON storage, GraphQL queries, and comprehensive testing workflows

## Project Execution
**@squad-agent-conductor** now owns the execution flow. Your first task is to:

1. **Initiate Phase 0** - Direct @dev-hub-dev to complete onboarding and begin execution checklist improvement
2. **Coordinate agent collaboration** - Ensure @dev-hub-dev leads with @automation-orchestrator providing specialized support
3. **Monitor progress** - Track checklist completion and ensure each phase meets acceptance criteria
4. **Manage handoffs** - Coordinate between automation development and integration work

## Success Vision
By project completion, we'll have:
- Universal automation engine supporting any campaign type
- Daily onboarding funnel running automatically with safety protocols
- Template system enabling rapid creation of new automation types
- Foundation for years of future automation expansion
- Seamless integration with existing push-blaster infrastructure

**@squad-agent-conductor** - Please take ownership of execution and begin coordinating Phase 0 with @dev-hub-dev as the project lead.

Let's build an automation platform that transforms how we engage users while leveraging all the robust infrastructure we've already built!
